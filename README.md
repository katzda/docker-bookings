Run server-install script in Ubuntu VM. 

What it does:

Install docker, docker-compose, samba, open-ssh, generate public and private ssh-key pair, etc print out convenient messages how to proceed next, it can also uninstall everything. Usually I run this when I spin up a fresh ubuntu VM.

It also does a connectivity test to see if the github ssh key has been registered and used in authentication successfully.
